        <h2 class="title-cuisine">Serbian Cuisine</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Serbian cuisine (Serbian: српска кухиња/srpska kuhinja) is the traditional cuisine of Serbia, sharing characteristics with the rest of the Balkan nations (especially former Yugoslavia).
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Historically, Serbian food is characterized by influences of Byzantine–Greek, Mediterranean, but also by Turkish and to a lesser extent of Central Europe[1][2] Serbian law bans production and import of genetically modified food (GMO), which has caused a long-running dispute with the World Trade Organization, preventing the country from becoming a member of the organization.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The national dishes include gibanica (egg and cheese pie made with filo dough), pljeskavica (a ground beef/pork patty), ćevapi (grilled ground meat), and Karađorđeva šnicla (Karađorđe's schnitzel). The national drink is the rakia.
          Seasonings are usually salt, black pepper and paprika, while ingredients are fresh and of good quality. Eating seasonal food is very important, and many dishes are strongly associated with a specific time of the year.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          With Serbia being located on the crossroads between East and West, its cuisine has gathered elements from different cooking styles across the Middle East and Europe to develop its own hearty gastronomy with an intricate balance of rich meats, vegetables, breads, cheese, fresh pastries and desserts. It has much in common with the cuisines of neighboring Balkan countries. Its flavours are mild, fresh and natural.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          A number of foods which are usually bought in the West are often made at home in Serbia. These include rakija (fruit brandy), slatko, jam, jelly, various pickled foods, notably sauerkraut, ajvar or sausages. The reasons for this range from economical to cultural. Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition.

              <h4 class="title-ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
              <p>
                1 (3 to 4-pound) large head cabbage<br>
                1 pound ground chuck<br>
                1/2 pound ground pork<br>
                1 cup raw rice, rinsed<br>
                1 (1.4-ounce) package dehydrated onion soup mix<br>
                1 32-ounce jar sauerkraut (rinsed and drained)<br>
                6 smoked ribs (or ham hock or other smoked meat)<br>
                1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce<br>
                1 (10 3/4-ounce) can tomato soup<br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="method">
              <h4 class="title-ingredients">Method</h4>
              <p>
                1. Steam cabbage until outer leaves are limp, then remove leaves. With a paring knife, remove tough ribs from leaves without damaging them. Reserve tougher outer leaves, but don't use for rolling.
                <br>
                2. In a medium bowl, mix together ground chuck, ground pork, rice, and onion soup mix. Adding a little water will make the mixture easier to handle.
                <br>
                3. Heap 2 tablespoons of filling on each cabbage leaf. Fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over meat. Then fold sides to the center, and roll away from yourself to encase completely.
                <br>
                4. Heat oven to 350 F. Discard the cabbage core and coarsely chop any remaining cabbage except the tough outer leaves you have reserved. Spread chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch oven. Add the sauerkraut.
                <br>
                5. Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam side down. Cut the smoked ribs into pieces if using, otherwise, space the smoked meat of choice between the cabbage rolls. Cover rolls with reserved tough outer leaves.
                <br>
                6. Mix tomato sauce and soup with enough water to make a liquidy consistency. Pour over rolls until mixture is level with rolls, but not over the top. Then reduce temperature to 325 F and bake for 2 more hours.

              <p>
                1 lb ground beef 85% lean<br>
                ½ lb ground pork<br>
                3 garlic cloves minced<br>
                1 ¼ tsp salt<br>
                1 tsp ground black pepper<br>
                1 tsp paprika<br>
                ¾ tsp baking soda<br>

              <p>
              1. In a large bowl mix together all ingredients.
              <br>
              2. Using slightly over 1 Tbsp of meat mixture per sausage, shape the mixture into sausages the size and shape of a fat finger (roughly 3 inches long and ¾ of an inch in diameter).
              <br>
              3. Place all the formed sausages in a single layer on a platter. Cover the platter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (up to overnight).*
              <br>
              4. When you are ready to cook your sausages, preheat your grill to medium heat, 350-400⁰F. (You should be able to hold your hand a few inches from the cooking grate for 5-7 seconds.)
              <br>
              5. Grill the sausages using a fine grate grill pan for 4-5 minutes a side, until golden and springy.
              <br>
              6. Serve the cevapi with sliced sweet onions and flatbread (like lepinja or pita).

            <div class="ingredients">
              <h4 class="title-ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
              <p>
                1 cup finely chopped onion<br>
                1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck or a combination of beef, pork, and lamb<br>
                1 cup chopped parsley<br>
                1 tablespoon salt<br>
                1/2 teaspoon pepper (or to taste)<br>
                5 tablespoons vegetable, sunflower or pumpkin seed oil<br>
                1 (1-pound) package thawed #7 filo dough<br>
                6 large beaten eggs<br>
                1 1/2 cups Bulgarian or Greek plain yogurt<br>

              <p>
                1. In a large skillet, sauté onion and ground chuck until meat is no longer pink and the onions are translucent. Drain in a colander. Return meat-onion mixture to skillet and add parsley, salt, and pepper, and cook for 1 minute, mixing thoroughly. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
                <br>
                2. Lightly coat a 9" x 13" pan with cooking spray. Separate filo dough into two piles (about 14 sheets each) and keep covered so they don't dry out. Half will go on the bottom of the pie and half will go on the top.
                <br>
                3. Place 2 sheets in prepared pan and brush lightly with oil, folding in any overhanging edges. Add 2 more and brush with oil. Continue until you've used one pile of filo.
                <br>
                4. Spread the cooled ground chuck mixture evenly over the filo and to the ends. Begin covering the meat with the remaining filo, again using 2 sheets at a time and brushing with oil.
                <br>
                5. Brush entire top lightly with oil. Using a serrated knife and a sawing motion, cut burek all the way to the bottom into 12 squares.
                <br>
                6. In a medium bowl, mix eggs with yogurt and soda water. Pour over burek. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours. Pre-heat oven to 350 F. Bake 45 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving.
                <br>
                7. This makes a great luncheon course, entrée or appetizer and freezes well cooked or uncooked.

            <h2 class="title-recipes">Prebranac (Serbian Baked Beans)</h2>
            <div class="ingredients">
              <h4 class="title-ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
              <p>
                1 pound dry Lima beans<br>
                5 medium yellow onions (about 2lbs), sliced into thin ribs<br>
                1 cup sunflower oil<br>
                1 tablespoon sweet Hungarian paprika<br>
                2 garlic cloves, minced<br>
                4 bay leaves<br>
                1 pinch Salt and pepper<br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="method">
              <h4 class="title-ingredients">Method</h4>
              <p>
                1. Soak the beans overnight (for about 8 or so hours) in plenty of water.
                <br>
                2. Drain the beans. Place the beans in a pot and cover with water. (For each cup of beans use three cups of water). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the beans are very soft, for about an hour and a half (cooking time will depend on the type and the size of beans, so check them from time to time). Drain and discard the water.
                <br>
                3. Preheat oven to 375F.
                <br>
                4. In a large casserole or Dutch oven combine the oil with the onions over medium heat (alternatively you can heat the oil first, but starting the onions in cold oil will help release their flavor gradually and will give them mellower taste than the hot oil method). Simmer the onions for about 30 minutes, until very soft and deep yellow. You might have to add a drop of water from time to time to prevent onions from drying.
                <br>
                5. When the onions are done, add the beans, garlic, paprika and bay leaves to the casserole. Season with salt and pepper, add about 3 cups of water, and mix gently. (The beans should be somewhat covered in water, but not swimming in it.)
                <br>
                6. Place the casserole in the oven and bake for about an hour to hour and a half, adding more water if necessary (the beans should never be completely dry). When done, the top layer of beans should be gently caramelized and fairly dry, most of the moisture having evaporated, while the beans inside should be wonderfully creamy and coated with onions.
                <br>
                7. Let Prebranac completely cool before serving. Let it rest for a day in the refrigerator. Serve at room temperature (but not cold) with crusty bread.
