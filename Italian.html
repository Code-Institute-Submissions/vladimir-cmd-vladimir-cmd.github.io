            <hr>
            <p>
                Italian cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine[1] consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since the antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century.[5][6] Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity,
                especially between the north and the south of the Italian peninsula.[7][8][9] It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world.[10] It influenced several cuisines around the world, chiefly that of
                the United States.
            </p>

                Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[12] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[13] Ingredients and dishes
                vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.
            </p>

                Traditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.[83] Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures. During
                holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Eve, feasts can last for hours.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Today, full-course meals are mainly reserved for special events such as weddings, while everyday meals include only a first or second course (sometimes both), a side dish, and coffee. The primo (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto
                or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood.

                        <p>
                            150g plain flour<br> 1 tbsp golden caster sugar<br> large pinch bicarbonate of soda<br> ½ tsp cinnamon<br> 1 tsp cocoa powder (optional)<br> 30g butter<br> 1 egg, separated<br> 50ml dry marsala or white wine<br> rapeseed oil
                            or sunflower oil for deep-frying (see tip)<br> 50g dark chocolate, melted<br> handful pistachio kernels, finely chopped<br> icing sugar, to dust<br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="method">
                        <h4 class="title-ingredients">Method</h4>
                        <p>
                            1. Tip the flour, sugar, bicarb, cinnamon and cocoa (if using) into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub it into the dry ingredients until there are no more lumps. Mix the egg yolk and marsala and add this to the bowl, then mix the whole
                            lot together and knead to a smooth dough. Wrap and rest in the fridge. (Can be made ahead and fried the next day.)
                            <br> 2. Fill a deep-fat fryer, wok or deep saucepan a third of the way up with oil. Cut the dough into pieces and, working one piece at a time, roll them out as thinly as you can – use a pasta machine if you have one. Heat
                            the oil and keep an eye on it until it reaches 180C. Lay the dough out on a lightly floured surface and cut out circles about 11cm across. Wrap each one around a cannoli mould, using some of the egg white to stick the top edge
                            down and they're ready for frying.
                            <br> 3. Deep-fry the cannoli (with their moulds) one at a time, making sure they cook all over. They should take about 45-60 seconds in all and should be visibly golden brown (keep cooking a little longer if they aren't) and
                            the dough will bubble and blister. Carefully take each one out of the oil using the tongs and shake the cannoli off the mould very carefully onto kitchen paper. As you fry each one, make sure the oil stays at 180C at all times
                            and doesn’t get any hotter. These will keep for 2-3 days in an airtight container.

                            For the base<br> 300g strong bread flour<br> 1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)<br> 1 tsp salt<br> 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling<br> For the tomato sauce<br> 100ml passata<br> handful fresh basil<br>                            or 1 tsp dried<br> 1 garlic clove, crushed<br> For the topping<br> 125g ball mozzarella, sliced<br> handful grated or shaved parmesan<br> handful cherry tomatoes, halved<br> To finish<br> handful basil leaves (optional)<br>

                        <p>
                            1. Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface
                            and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
                            <br> 2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
                            <br> 3. Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs
                            to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
                            <br> 4. Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,
                            drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step
                            for remaining pizza.

                            2 tbsp olive oil<br> 15g unsalted butter<br> 1 onion, finely chopped<br> 1 large garlic clove, crushed<br> 350g risotto rice<br> 150ml dry white wine<br> 1.2l hot chicken or veg stock<br> 150g parmesan, finely grated<br> 1
                            lemon, finely zested<br> 150g ball mozzarella, chopped into 18 small pieces<br> vegetable oil, for deep-frying<br>

                        <p>
                            1. Heat the oil and butter in a saucepan until foamy. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and fry gently over a low heat for 15 mins, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another min. Stir in the rice and cook for a further min,
                            then pour in the wine. Bring to the boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Pour in half the stock and simmer, stirring continuously, until most of the liquid is absorbed. Add the remaining stock a ladleful at a
                            time as the rice absorbs the liquid, stirring, until the rice is cooked through (this should take about 20-25 mins). Stir in the parmesan and lemon and season to taste. Spread the risotto out into a lipped tray and leave to
                            cool to room temperature.
                            <br> 2. Scoop the cooled risotto into 18 equal portions – they should be slightly larger than a golf ball. Flatten a risotto ball in your hand and put a piece of the mozzarella in the centre, then enclose the cheese in the
                            rice and roll it into a ball. Repeat with the remaining risotto balls.
                            <br> 3. Put the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs into three separate shallow bowls. Dip each prepared risotto ball into the flour, followed by the eggs and finally, the breadcrumbs. Transfer to a tray and set aside.
                            <br> 4. Half-fill a large, heavy-based saucepan with vegetable oil and heat over medium-low until it reads 170C on a cooking thermometer or until a piece of bread turns golden brown in the oil within 45 seconds. Lower the risotto
                            balls into the oil in batches and cook for 8-10 mins, or until golden brown and melted in the centre. Set aside on a tray lined with a clean kitchen towel.
                            <br> 5. Eat the arancini warm, or serve with a basic tomato sauce for dipping.

                            1. Heat the oil in a large pan. When hot, add the rabbit, brown on all sides, then remove from the pan and set aside.

                            <br> 4. Remove the rabbit from the pan and shred the meat using 2 forks. Be careful to remove all small bones. Meanwhile, increase the heat under the pan and boil the liquid for 5 mins until reduced by half. Add the shredded
                            meat and reduce the heat to low. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water following pack instructions. Drain, reserving a little pasta water to thin the sauce if necessary.
                            <br> 5. Stir half the orange zest, mustard, cream and parsley into the rabbit sauce. Add the cooked pasta to the pan, toss everything well to coat and heat through for 1-2 mins. Serve in bowls with grated Parmesan, parsley
                            leaves and the remaining orange zest.
