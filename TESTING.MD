# Responsiveness on different browsers:

[Google Chrome](https://google.com) all the testing information has been tested on Chrome browser using DevTools.

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) and [Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/internet-explorer.aspx) browsers responsiveness is good on desktop, tablet and phone.

[Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) browser responsiveness is the same as Chrome browser, no bugs.

## Bugs whilst creating the website:

Navbar code was copied from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), I found the dropdown menu wouldn’t work and searched on [CI](https://codeinstitute.net/) slack channel and found I had to change the script order of bootstrap to JS, JQuery, CSS.

I couldn't find a way how to make navigation bar both fixed (goes with scrolling, doesn't disappear), and static at the same time, so when you click on a button in mobile mode, the navbar dropdown pushes the hero image, and not goes over the image.

Used codes from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/books/fundamental-css-tactics/scale-typography-screen-size/) to help with font-size responsiveness.

## Bugs to be fixed:

WHen I click on a last photo in gallery, it pushes the Subscribe to our newsletter section further down, thus creating white space.
